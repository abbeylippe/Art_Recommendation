# Art_Recommendation
A program that will recommend an avant-garde artist for further research/ discovery.

I often find myself wanting to explore a new artist's work, but I find it tricky to find artists whose work I will enjoy. This program includes a list of avant-garde artists,
and will perhaps be expanded to include some contemporary artists and to include architects as well. This is simply the art I find most interesting at the moment and the program provides a quick way to find art that is fun to look at, read about and learn about.
